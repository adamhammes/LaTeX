Note: $REG$ stands for the set of all regular languages, $DEC$ all decidable languages, $CE$ computable, and $co-CE$ co-computable.


\section*{Problem 89}

Let $A'$ denote the intersection of $0^*10^*$ and $A'$.
Then
	\[A' = \{0^m10^n \mid  m \geq n \}\]
Additionally, let $B$ be defined as follows:
	\[B = \{ \text{rev } a \mid A \} \]
where rev $a \in \{0,1\}^*$ is the reverse of the string.
This language can be alternatively expressed as
	\[ B = \{0^n10^m \mid m \geq n\}\]

Lemma 1: $B$ is not regular.

Let $c \in \mathbb{N}$.
Choose $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ such that $C(0^n) > c$, and let $x = 0^n1$.
Then
	\begin{align*}
		C( y^{B} _{x,1} ) &= C( 0^n) \\
		&> c + \log 1\ \checkmark
	\end{align*}

Since $REG$ is closed under intersection (proven in text) and rev (proved in earlier homework), we can say the following:
	\begin{align*}
		A \in REG &\iff A' \in REG \\
		&\iff B \in REG
	\end{align*}
Since $B$ is not regular, $A$ is not regular. $\checkmark$


\section*{Problem 90}

Consider $s \in A$.
By definition of $A$, $s$ is of the form $0^kx$ where $\#(0,x) \geq k$ and $k>0$.
Note that $x$ must contain at least one zero.

Let $y$ be $0^{k-1}x$. $x$ has at least one 0, so $0y \in A$.
Also, $0y = s$.
Because $k >0$, such a $y$ exists for every $s \in A$.
Thus we can can express the language $A$ as follows:
	\[ A = \{0x \mid \#(0,x) > 0 \}\]
which is decided by the regular expression
	\[ 0\ (0+1)^*\ 0\ (0+1)^*\]


\section*{Problem 92}

Let $P_\infty$ be the following property:
	\[ P_\infty = \{ n \mid L(M_n) \text{ is infinite}. \}\] 

Let $M_A$ and $M_B$ be Turing mahcines, with $M_A$ accepting on all inputs and $M_B$ rejecting on all inputs.
Then L($M_A$) is finite and L($M_B$) is infinite. 
Thus $P_\infty$ is non-trivial.
Since $P_\infty$ is non-trivial, by Rice's theorem $INF$ is undecidable. $\checkmark$


\section*{Problem 94}

Consider $R^C$,
	\[ \{x \in \{0,1\}^* \mid C(x) < |x| \}. \]
I prove that $R^C \in CE$, equivalent to $R \in co-CE$.

Let $U$ be a universal Turing machine.
Define $M_R$ as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item input $x \in \{0,1\}^* $
	\item let $A$ be $\{0,1\}^{\leq |x|}$
	\item for $i \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ from 1 to $\infty$:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item for $a \in A$, run $U(a)$ for $i$ steps
		\item if $U$ outputs $x$, ACCEPT
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Consider $x \in R^C$.
Because $C(x) < |x|$, there exists a Turing machine $\pi$ such that $|\pi| < x$ and $U(\pi) = x$.
$M_R$ iterates through every possible encoding of a Turing machine with length less than $|x|$, accepting if and only if the universal Turing machine outputs $x$ on that encoding.
Therefore $L(M_R) = R^C$. $\checkmark$



\section*{Problem 96}

From 95 we know that every c.e. subset of $R$ is finite.
Because $R$ is infinite and a subset of itself, we know that $R \notin CE$.
Since $DEC \subseteq CE$, we can conclude that $R \notin DEC$. $\checkmark$.
