\section*{Problem 90}

Consider $s \in A$.
By definition of $A$, $s$ is of the form $0^kx$ where $\#(0,x) \geq k$ and $k>0$.
Note that $x$ must contain at least one zero.

Let $y$ be $0^{k-1}x$. $x$ has at least one 0, so $0y \in A$.
Also, $0y = s$.
Because $k >0$, such a $y$ exists for every $s \in A$.
Thus we can can express the language $A$ as follows:
	\[ A = \{0x \mid \#(0,x) > 0 \}\]
which is decided by the regular expression
	\[ 0\ (0+1)^*\ 0\ (0+1)^*\]
